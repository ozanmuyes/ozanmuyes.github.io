## Using the Template

> [!NOTE]
> Although provisional package manager is `pnpm` you can use any other package manager as you wish. In that case please be sure that the correct versions of dependencies were installed.

1. Clicking "Use this template" to create a new repository (on your GitHub account)
1. Clone the new repository to your development machine
1. Navigate to the local cloned directory

If you use VSCode / VSCodium as your IDE then it is highly advised to install recommended extensions. Please refer to the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_recommended-extensions).
